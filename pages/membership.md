## ECF Membership

If you want to play regularly for our [teams](/leagues) then we are required to charge you £3 per match for every game after your first unless you join the English Chess Federation at Bronze level or above. You can join the ECF online at [www.englishchess.org.uk](http://www.englishchess.org.uk).

To be eligible to play our matches for free we need to know that you are an ECF member - contact our [Treasurer](/committee) once you have joined.
