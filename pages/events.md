## Simultaneous Exhibitions

In the Trinity Term of 2019, we hosted a Simultaneous Exhibition against GM Hou Yifan, the current Women's World Number 1 chess player. Yifan is the youngest ever to win the Women's World Chess Championship (16), which she achieved 4 times, in 2010, 2011, 2013, and 2016, and the youngest ever to achieve the title of Women's Grandmaster and FIDE-rated 2659. Yifan is a Rhodes Scholar, and at the time was reading an MSc in Education at St Hilda's College for the 2018-2019 academic year.

In the Hilary Term of 2019, we hosted WGM IM Irina Bulmaga for a Simultaneous Exhibition of 20 boards. The result were 18 wins to Irina, 1 draw, and 1 win to second team member Tudor Enescu.

We have an upcoming Simultaneous Exhibition with GM Keith Arkell, to be held at Christ Church Library. Details will be posted here when announced.

The club also has a long history of running simultaneous exhibition. In 2013, we hosted GM Darmen Sadvakasov, ex-Junior World Champion. At the Second Annual Varsity Match against Cambridge, Johannes Zukertort ("the greatest player never to be World Champion") gave a six-board match blindfold whilst waiting for the final six games to finish; Joseph Henry Blackburne ("The Black Death") see [this report](../files/Second_Annual_Varsity.pdf) from the [City of London chess magazine](../files/The_City_of_London_chess_magaziney.pdf).
